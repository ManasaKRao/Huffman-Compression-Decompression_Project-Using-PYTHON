# Huffman-Compression-Decompression_Project-Using-PYTHON
Huffman Coding

This Python code implements Huffman coding for efficient data compression.

----Usage----

Provide the path to your text file:
Bash
python huffman_coding.py path/to/your/file.txt
Use code with caution.

The script will create two files:
path/to/your/file.bin: Compressed binary file
path/to/your/file_decompressed.txt: Decompressed text file


----Features----

Reads the text file and calculates character frequencies.
Constructs a Huffman tree to represent the frequencies.
Encodes the text using Huffman codes.
Pads the encoded text and converts it to bytes.
Writes the compressed data to a binary file.
Decodes the compressed data using the stored Huffman tree.
Writes the decompressed text to a new file.


----Notes----

For large files, compression might take some time.
The compression efficiency depends on the frequency distribution of characters in the text.
Additional Information:

Refer to the code comments for detailed explanations of the implementation.
Consider optimizing the code for performance, especially for very large files.
Explore other compression algorithms like LZW or arithmetic coding for different use cases.
